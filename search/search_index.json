I primarily use atomic force microscopy techniques to measure light-matter interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors and to study properties in III-Nitride NanoLEDs (in collaboration with NS Nanotech (https://www.nsnanotech.com/)) to help refine their fabrication procedure.  This platform serves as an invitation to accompany me on a scholarly journey into the fascinating world of 2D materials and semiconductor physics.  Through meticulous investigation, I aim to use Kelvin probe force microscopy to elucidate the fundamental processes behind persistent photoresponses in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, contributing to the furthering of 2D optoelectronic device physics. I extend a warm welcome to all who visit my website!</p> <p> Diagram of AFM operation Picture taken from wikipedia.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Sean is a 1st year physics master's student at McGill university who is interested in condensed matter physics. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Honours Physics with honors from the University of British Columbia. With a newly found interest in atomic force microscopy and nanofabrication procedures, he continues his research in the Grutter group, where he uses atomic force microscopy techniques to study two-dimensional semiconductors and III-Nitride NanoLED structures. In his free time, he enjoys playing games, ranging from strategy games to MMORPGs.</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Cooking</li> <li>Cycling</li> <li>Olympic Fishing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"about/cooking/","title":"How to cook toast","text":"<p>Put bread into toaster and hope.</p>"},{"location":"about/cycling/","title":"My Cycling blog","text":"<p>I've gotten a flat tire and there's snow outside.

In a surprising turn of events, Dr. Simpson achieved a remarkable feat by securing an Olympic medal in fishing. Her passion for this age-old practice, cultivated during moments of respite from the rigors of academic research, led her to compete on the international stage. Driven by discipline, patience, and an innate connection to nature, she demonstrated an exceptional skill in the art of angling. Her Olympic success not only reflects her versatility but also serves as a testament to the notion that the pursuit of excellence transcends conventional boundaries, showcasing the multifaceted nature of an individual whose talents extend beyond the confines of a laboratory or observatory.</p>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":"<p>Here are some projects that I am working on. </p> <ul> <li>Python Project is an amazing python project that will allow you to see my coding skills.</li> <li>Data Project is an even more amazing project where I share data that I've used.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/data_project/","title":"Data Project","text":"<p>My research is very interesting, and the wider community is very interested in my data.
